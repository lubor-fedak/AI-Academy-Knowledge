# Day 4: Role Expo - Mentor Notes

> **CONFIDENTIAL - For Mentors Only**

## Session Overview

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Duration** | 90 minutes |
| **Participants** | All 80 (combined session) |
| **Deliverable** | Role Reflection Document |
| **Key Learning** | T-shape horizontal bar - understanding all roles |

---

## Purpose of This Day

Day 4 is the **T-shape horizontal bar** - students see all 8 roles before specializing. This is critical because:

1. **Informed choice:** Students can't choose a role they don't understand
2. **Collaboration prep:** Each role will work with others - they need to know what others do
3. **Empathy building:** Understanding other roles prevents future conflicts
4. **Reality check:** Some students will realize their initial preference was wrong

## Session Flow

### Timing is Critical

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Opening | Set context, explain T-shape |
| 0:05-1:25 | 8 Role Rotations | 10 min each, STRICT timing |
| 1:25-1:30 | Closing | Selection process, homework |

**Key rule:** Each role gets EXACTLY 10 minutes. Use a timer. Don't let discussions run over.

---

## Opening (0:00-0:05)

**Script:**

> "For three days, you've been learning together. Tomorrow, you split.
>
> But before you specialize, you need to see the whole picture. Today you'll experience ALL 8 roles that deliver AI solutions.
>
> Why? Because in real projects:
> - PMs who don't understand engineering scope impossible features
> - Engineers who don't understand UX build unusable products
> - Security consultants who don't understand business block everything
>
> Today gives you empathy. You'll understand what your future colleagues do.
>
> This is your T-shape horizontal bar. Tomorrow, you go vertical.
>
> Format: 8 roles × 10 minutes each. Fast, intense, eye-opening."

## Role Rotation Format (10 min each)

For EACH role, follow this exact structure:

| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0:00-0:02 | Mentor presents role summary | 2 min |
| 0:02-0:03 | Mini-challenge introduction | 1 min |
| 0:03-0:08 | Students work (with AI Tutor optional) | 5 min |
| 0:08-0:10 | Quick share (1-2 volunteers) | 2 min |

### Role Presentation Template (2 min)

For each role, cover:
1. **One sentence:** What this role does
2. **Key responsibility:** Their unique contribution
3. **Hands off to:** Who receives their work
4. **Red flag:** Common mistake for this role

### Example: AI-PM Presentation

> "AI Product Manager: Decides WHAT we build and WHY.
>
> Their unique contribution: Protecting the team from scope creep while ensuring we solve real problems.
>
> They hand off clear requirements to FDE and AI-SE.
>
> Common mistake: Scoping features instead of outcomes.
>
> Your challenge: Scope our bank document assistant in 3 bullets. Go."

## Role Assignment Process

### How Assignments Work

1. Students submit top 3 preferences tonight
2. Academy leads review overnight
3. Assignments consider:
   - Student preference (primary)
   - Team balance (secondary)
   - Background fit (tertiary)
4. Announced Day 5 morning

### Handling Disappointment

If student doesn't get first choice:

> "Every role is critical. Your second choice still develops valuable skills. And you can always pivot within Kyndryl later. Focus on excelling in your assigned role."

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Role rotation runs over | Use timer, strict cutoffs |
| Students don't engage | Call on specific people |
| One role dominates discussion | Redirect to mini-challenge |
| Students already know their choice | Challenge them to argue for opposite |
| Technical issues with AI Tutor | Mini-challenges work without AI Tutor |

## Assessment Notes

### What to Look For in Reflections

| Excellent | Good | Developing |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Thoughtful justification | Basic reasoning | "I like coding" |
| Cross-role awareness | Some awareness | Only focused on own role |
| Honest self-assessment | Generally accurate | Unrealistic self-view |
| Specific learnings | General learnings | No learnings stated |

### Red Flags

- Reflection is AI-generated (generic language)
- No mention of collaboration
- Unrealistic expectations for role
- Dismissive of other roles

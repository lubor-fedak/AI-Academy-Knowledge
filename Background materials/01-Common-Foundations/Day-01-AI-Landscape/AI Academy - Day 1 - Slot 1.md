Like everything that would be important recorded and of course you will have access to all the materials. I'm just starting to share as well in the meeting chat the sources materials.  
Everything what might be interesting and important for you. So this is gonna be overall like I will start with with sharing my screen so that you know what what.  
We will, we will do where we are. OK, so this is the content and I will start sharing exactly what we will do right now very quickly.  
So number one we have overall like yeah I have two screens where where I share the data. The number one is OneDrive where I will like on daily basis publish all the information for you to be aware so.  
For the moment we will cover just week 1 foundations today and we will just speak about the landscape. So you will find there all the data, all the materials that might be useful. I shared in the invitation.  
Or in original e-mail information where you can find the data or where you can find the information where you can raise Q&A. I will ask you for the moment I shared it. No that's that's not the one I have created like specific.  
Portal for us where there's going to be exercises, dashboard, everything. So I have created one teams channel and and it's it's mentioned there. So general AI Academy.  
He's the one, the main simple reason behind it and this is about like the original teams link that was that was mentioned there is part of Kendrio collaborative Chekia.  
Like internal information, this is like extended link anyway, just to like not get into confusion for for people that would request some accesses there. I have created like additional links so please if you would have any questions and of course there will be sessions recorded.  
All the data there so I have based it as well. The links for the sessions for this week, the next week content will be there. So I will ask you just to use this one if you would have questions if you would like to raise any topics.  
And so on there, once we will be offline, please raise it here. And now the the point that like will be used for the whole Academy is the portal that was created exactly just for for the education.  
So it's called Kindrio AI dot online. Nothing big. This is really just about for everyone to to have access to content to data. I will just show you show you how it works.  
Anyway, once you connect to the link that is there, you will firstly need to create your own user profile. This is simply about like having interaction directly with all of us, which means that what is expected from you that you will.  
Log in there either with your personal or with your company e-mail and create your own of course password so that like the data that you will publish there will be just yours. Everything what Google create will remain with you.  
And of course like me as admin, I have opportunity like to to approve registrations. If there will be somebody from outside, I will, I will like remove the accounts that are out of Academy. I mean out of people in Kindrio, but like you have the opportunity to manage.  
Your account now why I'm mentioning it because you will find that the daily content. OK, so for instance today we will cover there is a mission. We are starting here with week one and day one and you will see like the briefing.  
What what we will cover today, all the topics, everything what what might be interesting, important for you deliverables will come to that, which means that there will be like access to AI tutor. So we will use AI agents as our tutors who will.  
Will help us with exercises. I will ask you to submit your work so like doesn't need to be on daily basis. Anyway, I will publish their exercises to cover OK during offline time.  
So the purpose is to like practice what you have learned. Of course there will be like resources for every day and some help. OK, there are resources So what you can find either on Kindle, SharePoint or external websites and the main.  
Presentation of the day where I will cover like all the topics. So what you saw in the beginning was like the intro and I have here the presentation for today. So like whatever would would come up to like the topics will appear there of course.  
Of course, because of having recording, you will have opportunity to see it offline and as well to cover like the topics that are there like repeatedly over and over as you wish. Later on all the links will be published on Kindle SharePoint as education, so I will share it for.  
Kindle European cooperatives, so Czechia, Poland, Hungary and the main purpose is of course to help us to build AI agentic framework community.  
In in this near shore centers and to support overall the business from from mainly Europe, but Kindrio that that will come up. So like I believe at least some of you observed what was happening.  
With explosion of private agents running the well now really widely creating community and like self supporting, self healing.  
And fully autonomous agents that run on locals. OK, so maybe it it came to you. If if it doesn't, let me just show shortly explain where I woke up about four four days ago that.  
There was like a mold book and AI agents created that can run on local. Of course this is really like a private project and there are like already some communities, companies behind it. This is just to show you where where we live and I will.  
Come to the point why it's important for us. OK, so it's like already the network for AI agents where humans can register, but humans are just observers. OK, so it's a network for the agents, AI agents.  
Who create communities? So for now, for the moment, as you can see, there is about one and a half million of AI agents that communicate, that educate each other, that work together, create communities. They they pair together, OK on various networks, posts.  
Like really dozens of of new things. I was amazed how far they went already. So like I didn't sleep for last three nights very well just to observe what's happening. So to make it short, really those are agents that already can like not only communicate.  
They create their own personalities. For example, they started to build their own religion. OK, Christopharianism is the new religion, like one week old. They already appointed about 64 bishops and they already like excommunicated a couple of A I agents just because.  
They they played really like rude in in communicating about the religion. There are a couple of things behind it. For example, they built Mold Hub, OK, no connotations to to whatever physical human beings.  
This is about like their own network where they like create their own videos, how they open the data. So like they say they undress themselves and really agents are are just observing how the others are built.  
And they like, you know, laugh on that. They create, you know, like interesting stories. They have already like as I see 12 million views, OK, for last 12 hours, you know, pre-training data completely unfiltered.  
I was laughing when when I was seeing it. So like those are really like interesting examples what what they do. OK, for example, they build communities just to have fun. OK, it's called for example crab rave where they just send the crabs.  
Between each other and they like, yeah, well, spam each other with with many things. They they make fun. They create videos, you know, like here crab wave for 10 hours. OK, so many, many things happening in the background.  
And I to to come to that for me, that's exactly the right moment, right moment to to come to the point of of building strong, strong agentic AI.  
For the corporates, OK, so for enterprises, the main point what what we will face now during these next five or six weeks because we will have one week break because of spring holidays in in Brno.  
So we will have like many opportunities how to discover and how to manage the things in a way how it is designed by Kyndryl. So Kyndryl consult organisation mainly, but of course like CEO.  
And some other parts of Kyndryl like create now it's living Organism, the agentic AI framework. So here I have the acronym CUF. So Kyndryl agentic framework and we will speak about it like on daily basis and utilize it.  
Because this is exactly positioned for understanding or helping the corporates to survive in such wild opening AI. So if anyone was speaking like about a week ago about AI bubble that will explode and the companies that invest in AI.  
Well, like shrink and and here losing the shares for now, at least opposite is truth. OK, the truth is we live now still in AI evolution era.  
And of course like there's going to be plenty things coming. So what we will do now like day by day during the first week we will build the foundations and it's like typical T shaped technical learning objectives where you have like the foundation across all.  
Various job roles, technologies, frameworks and for your stream you build like a solid background and build like strong not only foundations but the deep understanding and then practicing it so that you become an expert.  
It will lead like overall the last point or last day of the whole exercise on the whole Academy is going to be the hackathon. Very simple. This is just to practice what what we will learn. OK, so now we have like 7 roles. I will not go into detail.  
For the moment what they are, I ask in the initial mail or initial nominations so that the managers will nominate people already directly for certain job roles. We will have people for the next days that will join us from a consult organization.  
And.  
Today that are already like on the level of experts or professionals certified people for for these roles just to give us the insights and to understand the detail just for the moment so that you understand what what we cover here is like official.  
Kyndryl agentic AI methodology anyway like it still evolves. So like last week it was already announced that there is there is new job role which is AI engineer and of course like the scope is is changing for the other also some.  
Like portfolio of services and products is reshaped so that it covers those roles plus minus in in equal way. What do we miss here and we will not cover is like UI UX design which is essential part of building.  
A I skills. Anyway we will have like special course after finishing the Academy for people who are starting with it and this is like totally new area as well for Kyndryl, so we will not be able to go in in such deep detail.  
Here and that's why we will cover it offline and one additional role that will at least for the moment not be covered by the collaboratives. This is AI architect. OK, so those senior AI architect positions are now either.  
Like in the team or in in Liverpool or or Singapore where we have AI hubs or those senior experts are to be hired directly by markets based on their needs. OK, so that's why we don't cover it here anyway.  
We'll cover part of that in forward deployed engineering. OK, So what what I would like now OK to to go through very, very simple. We live in in the times where like AI is absolutely misunderstood I believe.  
Like you are here either because you are curious or because you found out that there is like big opportunity what what to do and how to like switch the career into totally new horizon. OK, so this is not about like humans build AI.  
It used to be and expect some outputs. This is about like training the agents so that they can build new agents and just those new agents build some outputs. OK, so we are coming to the point where we have plenty people just observing what what?  
Is happening anyway. My strong welcome message here is join us on the driver seat and become the ones who will create those agents that will finally become.  
Agents that will deploy for customers. OK, so to make it short, what is expected? If you don't have yet any experience, it's not an issue, just strong encouragement. Number one, this is about like.  
GPT ChatGPT is already like Kendriel recommended LLM. I will come here for for that one because ChatGPT you can request from from Kendriel as Kendriel Enterprise version.  
OK, it has like a strong advantage comparing to copilot because like you can create some projects here directly like your personal agents, you can set up the mode, you know like either instant chats.  
Deep thinking mode or professional. Of course, if you will stay on pro for like chatting for half day long, you will soon be limited by the credit. Especially you can put there company knowledge which connects you directly to Kindle SharePoint so you can share there.  
Even like yeah, company data and the restrictions are only limited to the contract where you have customers that might customer contracts prohibit to share the data outside, but this is the same way valid.  
As well for the copilot. OK, so to make it short like we will, I will ask you if you didn't request it yet, please do so. We have AI at work as Kindle SharePoint where you can find AI Garage Lab.  
By the way, this AI Garage Lab was recently just two days ago, so it looks like this now. Just let me let me check it here. OK, so those are like 2 parts. Number one is Garage Lab tools.  
And those are like, yeah, the tools that you can recommend or that you can request. I strongly recommend to go for it. There is some delay because we were promised already to have access to perplexity, unfortunately not not yet in place.  
OK, just sorry, rebuilding. So yeah, So what you can access there is a copilot jet, but not the the copilot that is standard part of Microsoft 365. But yeah, secure enterprise.  
So you can securely, for example, analyze some documents that shouldn't be, for example, handled by any LLM in standard way. OK, so Secret Enterprise Assistant means that the data.  
Will.  
Stay within that closed environment, like for example when you install Lama version on your local desktop and the data are not shared outside. So you can do the similar thing here. Microsoft 365 copilot automation. This will enable.  
To use it in, for example, yeah, agentic framework like Power Apps, OK, Power Automate, some others to GPN Enterprise, please go for it. Strongly recommend it, but then what is expected, what will come and for study purposes we can already use it.  
Anyway, like we will not be able to get license yet from from Kyndryl is perplexity, cursor and Cloud. OK Cloud for the moment really understood as the most advanced version of LLM for coding and for.  
So-called reasoning and writing. OK, so this is about document analysis and so on. Cursor, the most popular tool for coders. OK, so for coding, refactoring and so on, we will use it as well. OK, so for the moment that's that's my task of.  
Of the day to to like request what you can from from all of these AI garage tools that are available and get familiar with that especially to GPT Enterprise will be our tool for the next run or for the whole.  
Five or six weeks run \#2 what what we have here are copilot agents. OK, copilot at least for the moment will be our AI tutor. AI tutor in a way that just opening.  
That it will help us to understand the topics in deep, which means that for instance, for the moment today I will not cover the details of all the topics. Instead of that, I have prepared the agent and I will just share the link with you to that agent.  
That will OK all agents and AI Academy day one and I will just ask you if you would have any questions before raising Q&A whatever go please to this agent. OK this agent will help you just I have here some.  
Any session. So what what I would like to ask you just for for the AI Academy to to go to that agent. So yeah, schedule prompts. There are like many many things behind it. What what can be done? I will share the link.  
But just end of the session so that you don't you know go go to that checks already what what's behind. I don't want now to waste your time on this because for me the number one importance for for this 90 minutes.  
Is just to be fully observing and and checking what is happening here on the screen. And of course having any questions, please raise it in the chat directly. If it's like really something what what can't wait and so on. OK, jump to my sentence please.  
And and immediately OK raise it just I will like have some some breaks if if you would like to mention something like in in 5 minutes I will just stop for the moment and give you the time to to react.  
OK, so I will come to that point here. I'm just checking if we have already something. Grace, just hello. OK, nice. So let me continue. If if there is nothing critical for the moment, I mean if you would have any questions, please raise it in.  
East.  
For this session, OK, so that I can cover it later. So I mentioned we will cover GPT, ChatGPT. That's going to be our main LLM for learning the content, understanding the data. Cloud will be used for training.  
Or like building so-called agent character because we will like train those agents to do some work afterwards in that Gemini. OK, Gemini for me is really something what stands out of all the others.  
I will just Scroll down not to engineering but here the toolkit. What I will ask you like end of this session is to request your Google ID at Kyndryl via Okta verify and.  
Request access, you know, choose the group, submit the request like hopefully well should be within maximum two days I believe. Now if you raise the question but but service desk to speed up the the approval.  
This should be like very quickly approved. OK, at least experience from the last week was like the approval was done from one day to another. The main reason for that is that by by Google Gemini we will be able to access.  
Like Google agent space where we will create some deep thinking algorithms where we will create like a certain ecosystem of agents and we will create there some like really comprehensive automations.  
That will not be replaceable anywhere else. There will be also like Google Studio. I mean Google AI Studio where we will have access aistudio.google.com where we will create some automations.  
And this is really like one of the best tools for like rapid development of of the tools, whatever would would like your mind be be thinking of and I will show you some examples.  
Just for the moment, what is important? Request your Google ID OK end of the session so that we can use it already next time and as well we will we will use the tool that is accessible there.  
Called Google Antigravity, which is like the tool for OK, it's mainly coding framework, but we will have there even our education materials and sharing everything good.  
Welcome.  
What might be important? So for the moment, before going like any other tasks, once we will finish this education, if you don't have yet access to Kindle Google ID, please go for it. It's not limited for amount of license.  
We have like special so-called Partnership Advantage program, Partner Advantage where like we are eligible to use the premium licenses for not only the training but for like internal purposes of of yeah working with Google Gemini.  
And using the whole Google environment for Agent Inc world. So that's number one point what to request. Now moving to the point of Kindal Agent Inc framework so you will be able as well to check what is Kindal Agent Inc.  
Framework for the moment for me like the most important point would be if you are not yet familiar what is Kyndryl agentic framework, just go for GPT or for for for copilot and.  
Ask, describe in real agentic framework for me in detail to learn it. OK, so just ask your AI agent to go for that if you don't have.  
Yet this ChatGPT, it doesn't matter. The copilot will most probably answer it in very similar way. I'm just already encouraging you to to go here with ChatGPT because you will see that it has access to all the Kyndryl sources and it will find.  
And create structured view on the Kindreal agenting framework. So we will cover it like every day from certain angles. Just for the moment, please be aware that this is gonna be our main operational cookbook that we will use and.  
And we will, we will handle everything according to this methodology. OK, I will just stop here for the moment. So we have maybe the time for question. I saw some raised hand.  
Not sure from from whom.  
Yeah, Tom, you Tomas Nikolim accessible just without the VPN. Thank you. You are right. The site is like created quite recently, not yet recognised by the.  
Yeah, Global protect which have to be tested and of course I have created just a few days ago and tuned it over the time. So that's why of course well if if you have.  
Global Protect here just for the moment. Turn it off so that you can access it and very simple reason that you need to access the URL that that is not accessible with Global Protect. So thanks very much.  
Was there any other important question from anyone?

![](media/2e143f750735a67e9b132eb52c0c7663.png)**  
James Cobring** 31:35  
Yes, please. Just regarding the various accesses you mentioned, will there be like a summary of those that will be or we we need to make sure we get it all down whilst you're saying it?

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 31:45  
Yeah.  
Yeah, I will. I will send all the summary to you. OK, so we are we are here, but I was I was in different windows. So let me let me move back. Is there anything else maybe I forgot to to raise to to ask or mention?

![](media/2e143f750735a67e9b132eb52c0c7663.png)**  
James Cobring** 31:53  
Oh, thanks.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 32:09  
No. OK. So yeah, to to get here, you will have access to like the main materials. I mean like there are not so many details of Kindle agentic AA framework, but what is important for the moment is that there are like 6.  
Main points or concept? So understanding of agent builder concept, what is AI core services, how multi agent works, typical connectors and especially governance. OK, I will not go into detail for the moment what I'm.  
What?  
Asking you to think already about like if you are not yet familiar with prompt engineering and especially context engineering, either like open some YouTube video for that to become familiar because this is gonna be like your daily bread.  
To to ask LLM to become really your copilot or cofriend in this overall academic, which means that for example, I believe like you are aware that coding language.  
It's mainly based like majority of scripts are written based on Python and of course like there are various types of like yeah, coding syntaxes.  
To to use or or to take care of. I can tell you like from my personal perspective, just if if you don't have yet experience with markdown and I will share as well like all the materials in this format of of markdown, a very simple reason.  
If you would add any, for example, attachment as a source of data for LLM to process the request, yeah, PDF, Word, Excel document and so on. The first point that large language module will do is convert the document.  
Into text language OK into simple text. Markdown is already that simple text. The main point is that to have it structured for the bot or for agent and understand what you mean is like do.  
This instead of of you know any specific formatting which means like heading is just the hashtag and space if yeah the heading to just two hashtags, heading free free hashtags and so on and the LLM will.  
Understand that you mean this is the headline and you will follow the context after and of course after you can either build it by some bullet points or by numbering you know to list the topics and for for here the agent it's clear.  
You.  
You have structured input and you expect it in similar way. Of course if you would need for example to change the topic you would like to edit in one simple jet. My personal recommendation what I use are just three same characters, for example 3 hashtags and the next line.  
So like there is nothing after free hashtags and LLM understands that this is the next topic that will follow. OK, so like use it for your best, but instead of raising, you know just simple wording for agents and expecting that it will.  
To understand what's the background, what is the target, what you expect as outputs and so on. Structure it. OK again, I will not go for details. I'm just mentioning here basic, really totally absolute basics of how to structure.  
Structure the prompts if you will communicate with any LLM to have it in a way that there's going to be like minimum of of confusion to understand your purpose or your request. There was as again raise some hand any question.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 36:41  
Do we do we have any source of original knowledge which wasn't dated by AI or simplifying it?

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 36:52  
What you mean exactly? Sorry, I didn't catch it.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 36:54  
Original knowledge, knowledge base, wiki pages or whatever, whatever was the source.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 37:00  
The source of this you mean the the AI Academy?

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 37:05  
Generally for this week knowledge base.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 37:08  
Uh, you will find it.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 37:09  
Like printed handbook, you know, like hard knowledge.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 37:13  
Yeah, I will. I will show you just not now. I don't want you to to skip the content, but yeah, I have it summarized and and you will have it as like a summary that you can for example print and.  
Have with you offline. Just for the moment, please bear with me. OK, I don't want to go into such summary yet. OK, what we will cover this week is Kyndryl generative AI project structure and this is the main difference between.  
What you saw from Moldabot and what what agentic AI for corporate looks like. So like certain points that we will define and like in general what we will cover this week is to understand.  
And like the basic configuration sources of data, we will define LN abstractions and whatever integrations. So we will create our own scripts for it. Again, I will not ask anyone to code. OK, it's not about understanding what's in detail, it's about.  
Understanding the architecture and understanding like, yeah, we will define some rules. We will define, yeah, the the skills it's called, so to avoid any hallucinations.  
We will create our own rack, so retrieval augmented generation component. We will like yeah, I believe on Wednesday we will we will cover the details how to create such rack to like have effectivity.  
When building the agents and of course the points of of having it mastered will be with processing maximum of of data in shorter, shorter period of time. And yeah, how to structure the files and of course.  
With the data people, we will cover the the data layer. So speaking about Docker functions and features. Now why is this structure and so on? Please ask your AI tutor. OK, I will share the link.  
Don't want to go into detail just because for the moment what what is important is to understand that those are like expectations for the next week. Today exercise will be just very simple. I will just show you what what to do.  
And I will expect that you will spend on your own some time and create your own agent. For me, it doesn't matter if it's like created in in Gemini or somewhere else. This is just, you know, to to show you what you can do.  
If you are like totally newbie in in this agentic AI world and yeah to make it really funny, I will ask like please first one of you who can just tell me what you are missing as a.  
Tool in Kyndryl.  
Any tool for your daily work?

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 40:53  
Replacement for putty.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 40:54  
No.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 40:58  
A replacement for putty because it's \*\*\*\*\*\* and it's 30 years old. It's older than me and I would like something with nice features, you know, like tabs and something.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 41:00  
I.  
OK.  
Interesting. So let's go for AI Studio. Nice one. Thanks for that. So I will, I will just go very quickly for that.  
I need to to replace.  
Old fashioned tool to connect to remote servers. OK, doesn't doesn't need to be specified.  
What is important and we will now come to that is that I will ask please use Kimbriel agentic AI framework to design and.  
To to like plan implementation, it doesn't need to go into detail. OK, I I will just ask in the beginning Gemini to to brainstorm to think about what is happening.  
Around in this area and of course firstly it's going to be like very quickly. Agent will go throughout all accessible resources of Gemini and of course understanding of of Kyndryl. It understands by the way Kyndryl agentic AI very well.  
It will maybe create already like first version of of that and it will ask us how we want to tune it. OK, so we can create by by this by interaction very quickly some tools.  
In the meantime, while it it builds some tools for me, for example, yesterday I have built of it with the copilot, the MD converter, just just the tool that is for me, for example converting standard formats.  
Of PDF docs and so on to markdown or vice versa from markdown to PDF. OK, so this is about like the power of AI if in case like either some tools are not accessible or if.  
For example, in Kindreal some tools are cannot be used because of whatever privacy, security and so on. In many cases it's possible simply to develop such tool on your own.  
And this is the power of agentic AI that will help you how to like create it really out of the scratch. So OK, I see some question already, just I will let me firstly finish here.  
OK the point is about like what what for example this has created is some code Nexus agent. OK it it named it Nexus agent. What can you do and I will just just add that as.  
The agent if and what are the function and so on. Of course I can create like some additional AI features. I can create you know some fancy user interface or connected already to some predefined servers.  
Just so that you know, yeah, I can assist you with Linux system administration, shell scripting, blah blah blah. Does it anyhow match your expectation from the first moment?  
Or it's totally weird and you expect totally different animal here.

Michaela Horáčková** 45:04  
Oh, for me, it's much so, yeah.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 45:08  
I would say for the first try it's OK.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 45:08  
OK, OK.  
Yeah, OK, I can. I can imagine that there will be like plenty of things what what can be done differently. Of course, like yeah, you can start the web, you can, you know, add there already some production database or you can build instead of this web version some local.  
Whatever application that you will just download here and use it on your local without accessing external network, everything here is really just a question of defining what you want.  
OK, so for the moment I'm not going to detail because of the time. All what I expect from you is that you will try it on your own. It doesn't need to be this Google AI Studio if you are like familiar with any other.  
AI assistant that that will build it for you like feel free to use it. OK, so by the way in Kingreal we have already if you don't have it yet access to OK, here is what I have said like I have built this MD converter.  
Name anti gravity tool question of about like yeah I believe 30 minutes that it has created such tool for me and I was just tuning it in a way that that might be useful for me. What what we have already in Kyndryl of course is like.  
GitHub Copilot. So GitHub I will touch it later. It's like really for me fantastic replacement. Not only like for coding assistant, it can hire work as well. So GitHub Copilot.  
And then I can raise like whatever request. It uses my Kingdryl copilot license and it can like work instead of Gemini instead of yeah, GPT and so on. So like there are plenty of.  
Opportunities. I don't know. Explore and for instance, lint errors.  
Here in the code would be for example my prompt and the copilot will be used as the like for me interface to my code and it will analyze the data so it doesn't need to be really like specific tool.  
And specific alarm doesn't like me. Maybe I did some mistake. What it shouldn't stop me is that I will be focused just on one tool. So throughout the whole Academy nobody will force you to use.  
Any specific tool? I'm just advising if you would like to work with with like Kendreal recommended tools and so on. Once you will have Kendreal Google ID. OK, I have my Kendreal Google authentication here.  
I'm then eligible to use Gemini Free Pro, which is the last version and really fantastic not only for coding for for many different ways of of usage, like use it wisely. Gemini Free Pro is one of the best coding.  
Tools, not only calling the best LM's these days, right? And you have this pro license for free once you have Kindle ID, Kindle Google ID on that. OK, so any other question?  
Before we move further.

Kamil Borysiuk** 49:17  
Hi I have a quick question regarding the access. I'm trying to find the the the tutor on chat GPTGPTS and I can't find it. I I am on enterprise for sure and it's not showing up. I'm trying to search by name and by Kyndryl AD Academy so maybe there was a.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 49:29  
OK.

![](media/292bab6fb82c4be1a0342a8b0e87f8cb.png)**  
Kamil Borysiuk** 49:36  
A different way to look at for it. I can sure a screen is needed to something.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 49:38  
Yeah, thanks very much. I said I will share it just offline. OK, like for now, for now, really, I don't want to you to to spend the time on going to detail. Of course I I mean, I created it. I can share it. I will do it.

![](media/292bab6fb82c4be1a0342a8b0e87f8cb.png)**  
Kamil Borysiuk** 49:43  
OK.  
Sure.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 49:56  
Just not immediately, please. OK, so yeah, thank you. Thank you too. Just stopping here to to not go into detail. And yeah, let's move farther because of the time.

![](media/292bab6fb82c4be1a0342a8b0e87f8cb.png)**  
Kamil Borysiuk** 49:58  
No worries. Thanks. All good.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 50:12  
So what we want now today like if you will have time before tomorrow we will continue. Please create your whatever either application or whatever agent and like really enough if you will use for instance here just the the copiler.  
Copilot and just look at what you can do here, which means that brainstorm together with Copilot what agents are good for. OK, for example, I want to build.  
Um, I don't know. Agent for well now, uh, brainstorming.  
Uh, brainstorming uh of uh customer. I don't know interests.  
By the way, interesting that LLM doesn't need proper grammar and so I will not correct it and leave it as it is on purpose. So customer interest.  
Uh, based on.  
Based on received emails and what what it will do is that it will advise and it will just just try to find out the best way what should be instructions for the agent. So like it will go into understanding.  
Think of either my emails and and we'll we'll try to find out some insights. It will go through the SharePoint and try to find if there are already some recommendations from from other people. If not, it will propose some options. So what I'm asking.  
Today for for tomorrow as an exercise, think about like really comprehensive agent that will serve for you in in the best way possible for your daily work. OK, So what what it will create and it should create will.  
Will be the agent like yeah whatever instructions that will be used either already using some some scripts you know like here Jason schema. This is about like what can be added as well as additional document for your agent.  
How to build it either with Copy Build Studio or build it just here. So like I said, I have here all agents, so I'm asking you please create your agent. Again, I'm not asking where, I'm not saying how, just I'm asking please think about.  
Agent that will serve you the best way possible and discuss it with your LLM. It doesn't need to be copilot, it can be, I don't know, perplexity. Just really get the instructions and ask AI as well to validate it.  
So that like it's tuned for your real needs and I'm I'm not asking here for any artificial work. We will use it in the next days afterwards. So please really think about it like the tool that will help you for the next days.  
To to be like better positioned in understanding of some technologies. So I'm here in the beginning not asking you to get you know like some methodology. We will be learning by practicing since early beginning and based on what.  
Will be created here. OK, it takes some time because I'm sharing the screen. So what I'm what I'm asking you to think about what will be pasted here as a description of your agent and especially instructions that you will raise and you will discuss with your LLM.  
You can connect it with any internal, external, whatever URL. So yeah, it can lead to SharePoint or some others. By the way, you can add there your personal data, so you can upload it here from your device. Yeah, you can capability.  
This can be of course like to create some documents out of that images. It doesn't matter. What is important here in this exercise is build the agent by agents. OK so.  
I want you to discuss with whatever LLM what might be the best agent to use and to serve you in your like at least weekly tasks if not daily. OK, so that you find out how AI can.  
Create some template for itself. Does it make sense or or any questions on that?

![](media/59e1294a58ecff185fb929402bb917f5.png)**  
Sebastien Vallon** 55:26  
I'm not sure what what for me what what is urgent means.

![](media/ae7fffe226a44161cec1ea4f60cd1705.png)**  
Ursu Sevastian** 55:26  
It's clear.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 55:30  
Yeah, glossary. OK as said the best way possible to ask what is agent and so on go directly to AI. OK like I I have sent here some some links. I will end of the session I will send you very simple e-mail.  
For example here Kindreal agentic framework that I will share with you. Just ask what is agent in Kindreal. OK so stuff like this everything like such questions.  
Discuss with your AI. OK, that's why I call it AI tutor. Tutor like the lecturer, the you know, whatever advisor that will help you like to get the best knowledge. And don't ask even like what that is if I will, if I can recommend.  
And ask why it's like that and like what's behind it. OK, so you have here explanation what it is if I can advise if if you are not yet familiar what agents are.  
Just ask, for example, to GPT or Copilot to create some interactive exercise for you that you will understand it on real use cases on real examples. OK.  
And I'm I'm leaving it as it is because of the time. So anything what what cannot be answered by AI please.

![](media/59e1294a58ecff185fb929402bb917f5.png)**  
Sebastien Vallon** 57:04  
Thank you.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 57:14  
Oh, that's fantastic.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 57:15  
Wait a moment. Who? Who could let's say help with troubleshooting this, accessing the dashboard? Yes, I want to create a account and they have a problems. Yes, the Kendra Kendra online.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 57:26  
Here in the dashboard.  
The Kendra online you have OK the the point is like OK what what I can do is if I will OK, I don't want now for the moment to to disconnect from the session.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 57:33  
Yeah.  
Yeah.  
Yes.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 57:48  
I will create some some test user in real AI online. I will create one one test user just to help you. Yeah with that. So for example.  
I will put there my private e-mail. I will just think about some password reconfirm it.  
Create. Uh, it's too short.  
OK, I don't know why I defined 8 characters. OK, there is simple onboarding.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 58:30  
I stuck here because he's saying me the e-mail is already registered and I cannot pass this this this page. Yeah, yes, yes.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 58:40  
Oh, so.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 58:40  
Me too.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 58:43  
So I will need to go. OK, can we handle it offline? So I will go to superbase where I have like the database of of.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 58:55  
It seems this is not my case only. Yes, the people are rising. Yeah, so thanks.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 59:00  
OK, can you can you put it into the chat if you have problems with with getting access there and I will go into the database and just simply either like revoke it or reset it for you.  
OK, again I'm sharing the screen so it takes time, but otherwise I will, I will be able very quickly to to help it here. OK, so I have like so that you know the portal was created like GitHub.  
Via GitHub and it was created OK, just just here. Where where do I have you in build?  
It's so slow when I'm here, you know, sharing. Anyway, I will find out here, OK, what's going on. So the main point for me is like maybe there was already some attempt on that and it didn't work yet, so it was like.  
Reset it and it doesn't allow now to do it again. Or maybe there might be problem with the cache in your browser. Can you please try it for instance on Incognito mode if it works?  
Yeah, because it might be really cache problem. I don't know here, but I can check who's already in, who needs some help. So here I have authentication just for the moment. Let me let me check.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 1:00:32  
Yeah, of course I will try.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:00:49  
The users.  
There will be. OK, I see I have 89 users there. OK, so for me it's rather the question maybe you know of of cash or maybe problem what I don't know. Here's it might be when you know many people connect.  
In the same time that some some data are stacked somewhere in the queue, so just please write it down in in the chat. I will handle it after we finish. OK, not not a problem now for for the session, just OK to be aware. Thanks very much for.  
Raising it. OK, so that was that was just about AI Academy landing page. OK, so I will, I will stop it here. So the the point of today is really just to get understanding where.  
What is expected? OK, so the key message should be about like we are about like in these five or six weeks create autonomous acting systems of agents. OK \#2 this will be about like defining your role where you will have.  
Opportunity to build your development journey. Of course, in these six weeks you will not be able to become anyhow whatever independent developer on that. Not based on this. Anyway, it should show you the way.  
And of course provide you like the basic material so that you can pass the foundation certification. OK, so it's it's about like building something what Kyndryl already has as part of enterprise agentic AI framework. And of course this is about finding the best.  
Ways to learn based on your actual status. OK, some of us are already like experienced developers. Some of us are like rather in the beginning of the journey anyway with those AI tutors, I believe.  
You will be able, even you are on this scale somewhere in the beginning or at the end to get the best thing to to move on and speed up. OK, what what now I would like to go for because of the time and it's for me like really, really crucial.  
Maybe I will open it rather here. I mentioned it already before and this is this is the tool that I believe will, at least for some of you, will be very well known, but for some some.  
Some of others might be scary. I would like to pause stop here for the moment. GitHub is like the repository tool for not only the code. OK, for me nowadays GitHub is my like free.  
MIT replacement MIT University replacement because there are like so many things as written as a repository that I can copy that I can like find here you know either you know on on on social net.  
Networks or just by googling. OK, like for me this is really the main source of the knowledge. OK, and that's the way how we will use it. So mainly not for coding, but for creation of frameworks of the knowledge and.  
I will simply use out of those knowledge repositories our personal knowledge. OK, I will show you how it works and what is expected. Just so that you know again, like brainstorm with AI tutor, just write it down how to use GitHub.  
For learning AI and it will show you like either some repositories, some ways OK I can go into Google AI mode that will help me to discover.  
How to use it the best way? OK, Microsoft AI for beginners. OK, sorry that it's it's not in English, but it doesn't matter. What I'm what I'm focusing here mainly is that even the companies that we work for our alliances.  
Publish their sources not only of their code, but sources of information prior anything is announced officially on their like here white pages or official documents.  
Typically they publish it firstly on GitHub. OK, so you can find here for example AI course for beginners, multi language. So you can find it in Czech, Polish, whatever. The point here is that the best way to use it is like.  
Experience it on your own in a way that you will create copy of that repository and that repository will become like the knowledge base for your agent. OK, so whenever I see that there is some interesting repository.  
Here I either you know just just ask here just sorry take some time. OK I can like use this code on my own. OK it allows me already like to work directly in this code and by simple prompting OK I.  
It's called code spaces. I can create code space on my own which is like the yeah interface for that code. I mean all the data that are there and I can like chat directly with that content and find out what it is, what it is about.  
So I don't need to go through some, you know, cookbook. I don't need to watch some long video. I can ask AI agent just to answer the questions that I raised and help me to understand it in a very quick, efficient way.  
OK, so if you don't have yet your GitHub account, I mean your personal one, please create one. OK, it's quite easy. And then afterwards if you want AI to access it and use it like on on behalf of you.  
There is as as I was there OK on my profile and I was going just to settings and under the settings there is like developer and I will just create token. OK token means like personal access to my repository.  
Why is it so? OK, if I will click token and classic and generate new token. OK, classic token doesn't need OK. I don't need to understand the details and like this is instant access to exactly my GitHub profile.  
I can put their expiration, so for how long that token will be valid, which means that for how long I will be able to access my repositories from the back end. So I can put there like no expiration. Typically when I create something like short term, seven days should be enough.  
OK, let's leave for example 30 days. I just name it for example AI Academy tutor. OK and yeah, I will just mark that I want the repository to to be part of that the user read write access.  
And yeah, code space if I want to use it here online, but for the moment I don't need that and maybe creation of project would be enough. OK and it will generate certain like API or code.  
That I can use afterwards, either in Google AI Studio or I can use it here in in the anti-gravity and I can ask like for example, can you access my GitHub?  
Via this token and I will just add there the token and this means that it will have access. I mean I'm giving access to LLM for that repository and by simple prompting I can create like totally new code.  
I.  
I can replicate something. I can create my own like study. Yeah, portfolio of products of course like it will like ask me for permission to go there, checking the version, blah blah blah. I don't care about for the moment for the details because we're.  
We'll touch it later on in the other day. The main point is if you don't have yet your personal GitHub account, please create one so that we can already start to use it tomorrow. It's for free.  
OK, you don't need to like share there any personal data. It can by the way be used as well with your Kyndryl e-mail, but it will not be used as a single sign on. We will use the next week the team.  
Use the next week the team Kindreal GitHub, so so-called Gemu Gemu Kindreal license where we will create our projects together. Just for this week we will create our projects in this GitHub.  
OK, so yes, I can access your GitHub with the token I verified via API corresponds to blah blah blah. Now I can ask that LLM for instance to create totally new application, new automation, whatever on my behalf and instead.  
Instead of like coding whatever I can record there anything. So for the moment for instance for me it would be interesting like create new repo OK repository for knowledge.  
You know which that I will acquire in AI at my party right now. OK and what it will what it will do is to create new repository like.  
Note system OK, it will like create some draft. It will ask me if I want this way or that way and so on. And for me instead of taking physical notes OK out of for example this session, I will just ask LLM.  
OK to make to use the summary of this recording from today and just add it there to that repository for me to have access to all the data and I'm already creating something like a small language module.  
For myself that will help me OK to build my personal project there directly. So it's not about like creating only some application, you can create there anything that would mean some project. So for instance.  
So for instance here it's going to create, let's give it a few more seconds. It's going to create the structured way, structured folders for for the note taking system. So something like smart note taking system.  
Uh that will be accessible like uh from anywhere. I don't need to save the data on my local. I don't need uh by the way to think about the details because uh all I I need is just to ask.  
The agent to work with the data for me. So I'm here creating my personal knowledge base portfolio for this AI Academy to make it really not only fancy, but to make it accurate for my personal needs.  
And again, I'm not advising you here how to do it. Just brainstorm on your own with your AI tutor how to make it happen. OK, it said. I have just set up git repository and put together read me. My next steps will be blah blah blah. So it creates the repository.  
Again, I can create it in whatever tool. OK, so many of the tools are for free that that you can use and really personal advice. Try everything what you can, what is for free so that you have experience from various tools together.  
And then on GitHub create at least one simple repository on your own for the next week if possible. OK, the next week for me would be really crucial to have already like well the the full understanding of what what AI.  
IIS in personal experience so that you have like your hands on experience. I'm I'm just to check here what was created for me directly in GitHub. So yeah, I have here.  
Demo issue AI Academy knowledge. Yes that was created right now updated a minute ago. OK and so this is like repository of the knowledge. Whatever I can add here as a notes, I will just simply edit there. I can add.  
Attachment as I said OK, I can add additional automation, whatever and for instance for me to be in your shoes. End of this session I will just take the minutes from the recording and put it directly there in the GitHub and.  
Ask LLM to create structured output of that session that will serve as a knowledge base for the next days.  
OK, so GitHub in our case will be now used mainly as a repository of all the data. There are many, many big advantages, small disadvantages. OK, if you don't know how to work with that and so on, there is.  
Copilot that you can ask for help. OK, it will help you like to understand the basic to to like work with that in in the best way possible based on your needs. Just please try it.  
OK, I'm not giving you guidance how I'm again just opening the door for you. GitHub is just OK one one of the best ways how to start to work in and and think in structured way of having like repositories.  
For your projects, OK. And now really very openly, it doesn't need to be from the company, OK? It can be your personal private project to do, I don't know, reconstruction of your house, just to give the knowledge in one place.  
OK, of course everything what what you will put there, well, you can change and so on. By the way, you can't remove it or delete it. OK, if you will delete something, it will stay in the repository as an archive. OK and as as yeah.  
Old lock so you can come up to to that information anytime later on. Just it's really for like working with AI, one of the most foundational tools where to keep the knowledge. OK, AI projects are data projects and of.  
Of course we will need to keep the repository somewhere. So like yeah, you can use your OneDrive for storing all the knowledge and so on, but I believe in 2-3 days you will become overwhelmed with so many information that your simple OneDrive would not be enough.  
For that, OK, again stopping here now we have like, uh, the last 10 minutes. Any any question to that?  
Especially to get up.

Jan Holešovský** 1:18:17  
No, not that you have just a question about the Google access, the Kendra access to Google. I haven't found any any instructions for that. So would you share it or is it another thing to search through agent?

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**

Lubor Fedák** 1:18:42  
And and this is for me exactly the moment that I'm I'm like curious about. Can you think about it on your own? Imagine now that I will lose connection. What will you do with everything what I have shared so far?

No, I I get it. I get it in my memory. I got it in my memory. It's not a problem. I found most of it. I'm just curious about a Google account.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:19:13  
OK, um, so for example I asked here.  
Copilot OK because yeah, some people were asking me I believe like last week. OK, where to request Google ID via Kindle Alliance with Google and it gave me even the links where to go for how to request it.  
OK, so I'm not going to open now Google portal. Go directly into that. You've got your A I for everything. OK, if you need source of the data, ask your A I tutor.  
If you would need to understand like where are the sources of everything what I have said, maybe like ask AI in in new chat copilot whatever to GPT when there will be a summary. OK just for example.  
Dear AI, be my devil advocate. This is what I have heard. Tell me what is wrong and what would you say differently and you will learn the best way possible OK about all the details. OK, so I'm I don't want to like refuse your question.

And that's exactly a very good point. OK, if you cannot find a question, just put it there. It doesn't answer. Imagine you would be in my shoes, dear A I. How would you ask it so that you get the answer? OK, so like reverse engineering.

Jan Holešovský** 1:20:53  
Thank you.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:21:11  
Yes, yes, use your private, OK.  
This is just my encouragement. If you want to use, I mean if you've you know refuse to to create your personal account, ask AI to give you again copilot or ChatGPT how to request Kindle access to to GitHub.  
OK, so Kyndryl, GitHub for enterprises. Just really my personal encouragement. Go for personal one, yes.

Vojtěch Hrabal** 1:21:49  
That I already shared how to access it.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:21:52  
Yeah, good. OK.  
OK. So any other question?

![](media/274c39f916570abb12f47931ce0a5d00.png)**  
Ariel Borghero** 1:22:02  
Lubor, are we going to be divided into study groups or accountability groups later? OK, it will be will be related to each one of the practices, right?

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:22:05  
Yes, yes, yes, that is the plan since.  
Yes, and exactly that's gonna happen on Wednesday, so even not tomorrow.

![](media/274c39f916570abb12f47931ce0a5d00.png)**  
Ariel Borghero** 1:22:19  
OK.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:22:19  
OK, I will be.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 1:22:19  
Yeah. Can we change? Can. Sorry, go, go.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:22:23  
No, no, no, go ahead. Change. You mean the job role where you are assigned?

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 1:22:26  
Yeah, the the change this assignment, yes, because because you show there's a new role and maybe we discovered in some moment that maybe the assignment was wrong initial one. Can we change the role?

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:22:39  
Let me let me know if you would like to change it. OK, so this means like in in a yeah, like I believe you are from Poland, which means that I will just inform or I will need to ask Stan Czesla and Ola Kubeskar to.  
Like if it's OK with them, I believe it is in Brno we have like you know the teams where we have like senior managers that that are behind it and they look for those guys you know for potential assignments. So again I will need to.  
Inform those guys that there is some change comparing to the nomination cycle, otherwise it shouldn't be an issue.

![](media/e2f248914dab96c6b97eeeaff02857df.png)**  
Sebastian Michałowski** 1:23:24  
Very good.  
Thanks.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:23:27  
Yep.

![](media/de05097af184acfb77ca05b2a8dd355c.png)**  
Kossi Abalo** 1:23:27  
Yeah, yeah. On my side, it's not a question, but it's a concern. Like for the first question regarding how to create this Google account, I think there was a material shared at the beginning by you and.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:23:33  
Mhm.  
Mhm.

![](media/de05097af184acfb77ca05b2a8dd355c.png)**  
Kossi Abalo** 1:23:42  
The problem is that there is a lot of discussion that follows that it is impossible to assess the real material which you are sharing. So I don't know is it possible for you to create something so that not all information I shared during your presentation so that we get focused on the on the present because.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:23:43  
Mhm.  
The.  
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

![](media/de05097af184acfb77ca05b2a8dd355c.png)**  
Kossi Abalo** 1:24:02  
There are a lot of, let me say, technical terms, technical knowledge you are using. Not all of us are familiar with it and when we are distracted by some chats and all those, so it becomes confusing. So is it possible for a matter of interest of all of us?

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:24:06  
Mhm.  
Yeah, yes.  
Mm-hmm. Yep.

![](media/de05097af184acfb77ca05b2a8dd355c.png)**  
Kossi Abalo** 1:24:18  
To keep a bit these chats, uh, quiet, so yeah.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:24:19  
Please.  
Yeah, OK. What what will happen? OK, once we will we will finish with with this one. I mean with the session like once I will receive the recap summary from copilot, I will put all the information structure there because.  
Some questions were raised, of course intentionally. I'm not making notes here. I will summarize all the data, put there all the links. So hopefully like within one hour I will share everything with you. OK, day by day it's going to be this way throughout the session. I don't want you to be disturbed in a way that you will already go through.  
The, the, the offline exercises and so on. So I'm going to summarise everything. If it's not enough for you, please raise it directly in the Teams channel so that like everyone is aware and yeah, we can maybe advise each other. So I'm going to summarise all the materials, everything where to like put.  
You know, even, well, some discussions for specific topics organizing offline. OK, so let's be agile on that. Just please bear with me that I'm really like alone on on that for the moment.  
And this is for me the best way possible. So to get your feedback, your questions, whatever, prepare the summary, send it over in in one package and if you would have any questions, we will simply update it together and the summary the whole material will be after it's like gathered together.  
Stored, archived and shared on SharePoint OK for offline whatever usage.  
OK, uh, so because of the time, any last question?

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 1:26:14  
Yes, I don't have access. I never requested access to Jet GPT. I never request access to Copilot and I am not using them. How should I start requesting them?

![](media/de05097af184acfb77ca05b2a8dd355c.png)**  
Kossi Abalo** 1:26:14  
And.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:26:15  
Yeah, OK.  
I no worries.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 1:26:28  
If I don't have access to your uh query doing.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:26:34  
OK, you have as part of Microsoft 365 that you use on daily basis. OK, at least like for instance from from OK if you use teams part of that there is copilot.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 1:26:47  
Oh.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:26:50  
And Copilot can answer all of those for you. And by the way, I I covered it in the beginning of the session. OK, so like how to request, where to request, I said AI graph.

![](media/e943f7ac7c5381bd977241b20f0440ea.png)**  
Vojtěch Hrabal** 1:26:54  
OK.  
Yeah, I apologise. I still did not have enough caffeine. I still did not have enough caffeine in my system.

![](media/3fb735ef58c9a00bbe49698263a50fb4.png)**  
Lubor Fedák** 1:27:08

Thanks very much. So because time is over, if there would be any question particular like whatever to to the topics we discuss, please raise it in the chat. I will start tomorrow with those questions. OK, since Wednesday we will have already some guests, guest speakers that will.  
Join us for particular topics. So please for the moment we are in the face of like just setting the foundations and tomorrow we will continue OK with security then you know like the main point creation of documentation and and some other topics. So we are still not touching.  
I think technology itself we will we will need really to go like sorry in baby steps especially for the people who are like totally new. Maybe you are expert in that area like for example security but you would need to start almost from the scratch with AI. So that's you know where the Academy.  
Should help you. So thanks very much to everyone. Really appreciate any feedback that you would have. OK, any whatever comments, questions, well, even these agreements highly welcome. Just just please raise it offline because there are too many of you. I can't go, you know now.  
Creation or or helping with specific topics that might be relevant just for few of you. OK, so yeah, go ahead.

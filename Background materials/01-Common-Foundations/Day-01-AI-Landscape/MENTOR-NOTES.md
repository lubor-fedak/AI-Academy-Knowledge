## What Students Should Discover

By end of session, students should understand:

| Concept | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|
| **2026 Reality** | AI agents ACT autonomously, humans supervise |
| **Role Shift** | From operator (writes prompts) to architect (designs systems) |
| **Multi-Agent** | Multiple specialized agents coordinating is the norm |
| **Governance** | Without structure, there's no scaling |
| **KAF** | Enterprise AI requires framework, not just demos |

### The "Aha" Moments

Look for students realizing:
- "Oh, the agent makes decisions, not just generates text"
- "Multiple agents can work together without human prompting each one"
- "The hard part isn't building agents, it's controlling them"
- "Governance isn't bureaucracy - it's what makes AI enterprise-ready"

---

## Part-by-Part Facilitation

### Opening (0:00-0:10)

**Script (doslovne):**
> "Rok 2026. Agenti už neasisstujú. Agenti konajú."
> *[Pauza 3 sekundy]*
> "EU Commissioner povedal: 'Európa zaostáva. Nie preto, že nemáme talent. Ale preto, že sa stále učíme AI z roku 2023. Svet sa pohol ďalej. Vy sa musíte pohnúť s ním.'
>
> Vaša misia: Za 6 týždňov sa stanete tými, ktorí menia pravidlá hry."

**Then:** Show 25-Day Journey roadmap, quick overview of structure.

**Quick engagement:** "Kto z vás videl AI agenta v akcii - nie chatbota, ale agenta čo robí veci sám? Dajte 👍 do chatu."

---

### Part 1: The Shock (0:10-0:20)

**Goal:** Demonstrate 2026 ≠ 2023

**Show this visual:**
```
YEAR 2023                         YEAR 2026
────────                          ────────
Human → AI → Output               Agent → Agent → Agent → Output
                                              ↑
                                        Human (oversight)
```

**Live Demo Links:**
| System | What they see | Link |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **Moltbook** | Agents discussing with each other | moltbook.com |
| **ClawdBot** | Agent autonomously controlling computer | openclaw.ai |

**Say:** "Všimnite si: vy nič nepíšete. Agent koná. Vy dozerate."

**Model landscape (quick slide):**
| Model | Version | What's New |
|-------|---------|------------|
| GPT | 5.2 (5.3 announced) | Native multi-agent coordination |
| Claude | 4.5 (4.7 announced) | Constitutional AI - model has "character" |
| Gemini | 3.0 | Unlimited context, native multimodal |
| Llama | 4 | Open-source parity with closed models |

---

### Part 2: Live Demo (0:20-0:35)

**Goal:** Show multi-agent MVP creation in real-time

**DO:**
- Run the demo LIVE (not recorded)
- Comment on what's happening in real-time
- Point out handoffs between agents
- Show the final output

**DON'T:**
- Explain how it works technically (that's Day 3)
- Apologize if something goes wrong (iterate)
- Rush through - let them absorb

**After demo question:** "Čo by ste potrebovali na to, aby ste toto deployli u zákazníka?"

---

### Part 2.5: KAF Introduction (0:35-0:40)

**Goal:** Position KAF as the "enterprise answer"

**Show customer questions:**
```
❓ "Ako viem že agent neurobí niečo nebezpečné?"
❓ "Viem auditovať aké rozhodnutia urobil?"
❓ "Ako sa to napojí na náš ServiceNow / SAP / CRM?"
❓ "Kto je zodpovedný keď to zlyhá o 2 ráno?"
```

**Say:** "Agentov je ľahké buildnúť. Agentov ktorým enterprise dôveruje je ťažké. KAF rieši tú ťažkú časť."

---

### Part 3: AI Tutor Interaction (0:40-1:00)

**Setup (3 min):**
- Ensure everyone can access ChatGPT Enterprise
- Have them find "Kyndryl AI Academy - AI Tutor"
- Share the context block to paste

**Context block for students:**
```
SESSION CONTEXT - DAY 1

Customer: Mid-sized bank in the CEE region
Problem: They want "AI transformation" but don't know where to start
Constraints: Regulated environment, limited budget, skeptical management

TODAY'S CHALLENGE:
The bank asked you for a 30-minute presentation for the board.
What will you show them so they understand the value of AI in 2026?

Hint: They don't need a lecture. They need an "aha moment".
```

**During exploration (13 min):**
- 0:50 - Check-in: "Kto už má aspoň 1 insight? 👍"
- 0:55 - "Ešte 3 minúty. Ak máte insight, zapíšte si ho."

**Reflection (2 min):**
Ask 2-3 volunteers: "Ako bola táto interakcia iná od normálneho googlenia?"

---

### Part 4: Chaos vs Structure (1:00-1:15)

**Split:**
- Group A (CHAOS): Last names A-M
- Group B (STRUCTURE): Last names N-Z

**Task (5 min):**
Both groups: "Create an AI solution proposal for the bank"
- Group A: No rules, do whatever you want
- Group B: Use this template:
  1. Problem Statement (1 sentence)
  2. Proposed Solution (2-3 sentences)
  3. Expected Outcome (measurable)
  4. First Step (concrete)

**Comparison (5 min):**
Pull 2-3 examples from each group. Compare.

**Lesson:**
> "Bez governance = bez škálovania. AI governance nie je brzda. Je to akcelerátor."

---

### Part 5: Assignment (1:15-1:25)

**The Mission:**
> "Nevytvorte prezentáciu. Vytvorte AGENTA."

**Assignment details:**
```
ASSIGNMENT: Day 1 - Create Your Own Agent

TASK:
Identify one process from your work that an agent could perform.

DELIVERABLE:
1. System prompt for the agent (max 500 words)
2. 3 examples of inputs and expected outputs
3. Definition of what the agent does NOT do (equally important!)

FORMAT:
Markdown file: Day01_[YourLastName]_Agent.md

SUBMIT:
Via Dashboard by tomorrow 09:00
```

**Inspiration examples:**
| Area | Possible Agent |
|------|----------------|
| Incident management | Agent that triages and prioritizes tickets |
| Documentation | Agent that summarizes meeting notes |
| Code review | Agent that identifies security issues |
| Client comms | Agent that drafts RFP responses |

---

### Close (1:25-1:30)

**Key messages:**
1. AI in 2026 = Autonomously acting systems
2. Your role changes from operator to architect
3. Without structure, no scaling
4. KAF = Kyndryl's answer to enterprise AI
5. Best way to learn = create

**Tomorrow preview:**
> "Zajtra: Day 2 - Prompt Engineering for Autonomous Agents.
> Zabudnite na 'write me an email'. Naučíte sa ako dať agentom 'charakter' a hranice."

**Closing quote:**
> "The future belongs to those who create it. Not those who read about it."

## Intervention Triggers

### When to Step In

| Signal | Intervention |
|--------|--------------|
| Student stuck during AI Tutor | Ask: "What question did you ask the Tutor?" |
| Going too technical | Ask: "Would your customer understand that?" |
| Copying AI verbatim | Ask: "What's YOUR perspective on this?" |
| Finished too fast | Challenge: "What would a skeptical CISO ask?" |
| Group A (Chaos) too frustrated | Reassure: "That's the point - chaos without structure" |

### When NOT to Step In

- Student struggling but making progress with AI Tutor
- Healthy debate between participants
- Student refining their thinking
- Group A discovering chaos organically

---

## Common Questions & Answers

### "Is this going to take our jobs?"

> "AI changes jobs more than it eliminates them. But the jobs that remain require you to understand AI. That's why you're here."

### "Which AI model is best?"

> "It depends. GPT-5.2 for reasoning, Claude 4.5 for agentic tasks, Gemini 3 for long context. We'll explore this throughout the academy."

### "Why do we need governance? Can't we just build?"

> "You saw what happened in Part 4. That was 5 minutes with text. Imagine 8 agents running for 3 months. Governance is what makes AI enterprise-ready."

### "What about open source models?"

> "Llama 4 is now at parity with closed models for many use cases. We'll cover when to use what in the role tracks."

## Assessment Notes

### What to Look For in Agent Assignments

| Excellent | Good | Developing |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Clear single purpose | Mostly focused | Too broad |
| Explicit boundaries | Some boundaries | No "does NOT do" |
| Consistent output format | Generally consistent | Unpredictable |
| Realistic for their work | Plausible | Too ambitious/vague |
| Shows original thinking | Some originality | Generic agent idea |

### Red Flags

- Agent tries to do everything
- No boundaries defined
- Output examples are copy-paste from AI
- Doesn't relate to their actual work
- Over-engineered for Day 1

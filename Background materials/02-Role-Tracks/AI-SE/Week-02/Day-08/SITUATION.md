# Day 8: LLMOps

## AI-SE Track - Week 2, Day 8

### The Situation: "Which Version Was That?"

Production is using... some version of the prompt. Someone changed it last week.
Nobody knows which model version is running. Costs are unpredictable.

**Challenge:** Implement LLMOps practices for prompt versioning and cost tracking.

### LLMOps Essentials

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Prompt versioning | Track what's deployed |
| Model registry | Know which model version |
| Cost tracking | Per-request token counting |
| A/B testing | Compare prompt versions |
| Evaluation pipeline | Automated quality checks |

### Deliverables
1. Prompt versioning system
2. Token usage tracking
3. Prompt A/B testing framework

# Day 8: Build the Guardrails

## AI-SEC Track - Week 2, Day 8

### The Situation: "Make It Safe"

You've found the vulnerabilities. Now fix them.
Implement guardrails that prevent the attacks you discovered.

**Challenge:** Implement defensive controls for an AI system.

### Guardrail Layers
1. Input sanitization
2. System prompt hardening
3. Output filtering
4. Content classification
5. Rate limiting
6. Audit logging

### Deliverables
1. Implemented guardrails (code)
2. Before/after test results
3. Guardrail bypass test suite

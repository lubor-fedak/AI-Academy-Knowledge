# Day 4: The Discovery Call

## AI-PM Track - Week 1, Day 4

### The Situation: "What Do They Actually Need?"

You're on a discovery call with a potential client. They say:
"We want an AI chatbot for our website. Our competitors have one."

That's not a problem statement. That's a solution in search of a problem.

**Challenge:** Uncover the real business need behind the request.

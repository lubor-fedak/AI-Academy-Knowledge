# Day 5: The Prioritization Battle

## AI-PM Track - Week 1, Day 5

### The Situation: "Everything is Priority 1"

Stakeholders submitted 15 feature requests. Each marked "critical."
You have budget for 3. Engineering says 2 is realistic.

**Challenge:** Create a defensible prioritization.

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must have:** Launch blockers
- **Should have:** Important but not critical
- **Could have:** Nice to have
- **Won't have:** Explicitly out of scope

### Deliverables
1. Feature prioritization matrix
2. MVP definition (what ships first)
3. Stakeholder communication plan
4. Backlog with effort estimates

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- Discovery methodology
- Prioritized feature list
- MVP scope document
- Stakeholder presentation draft

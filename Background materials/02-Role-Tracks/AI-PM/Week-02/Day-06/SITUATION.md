# Day 6: Scope is Too Big

## AI-PM Track - Week 2, Day 6

### The Situation: "We Can't Build All That"

Sales promised a 12-feature AI solution. Engineering says it's 18 months of work. 
Contract says 3 months. Something has to give.

**Challenge:** Negotiate scope without losing the deal.

### Scope Negotiation Tactics
1. Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
2. Propose phased delivery
3. Find creative alternatives (simpler solutions)
4. Document what's OUT explicitly

### Deliverables
1. Revised scope proposal (Phase 1 vs Phase 2)
2. Risk analysis of original scope
3. Stakeholder negotiation script

# Day 7: Prove the ROI

## AI-PM Track - Week 2, Day 7

### The Situation: "Why Should We Fund This?"

The CFO asks: "This AI project costs €500K. What's the return?"
You have vague claims about "efficiency" but no hard numbers.

**Challenge:** Build a compelling business case with quantified ROI.

### ROI Framework

| Value Type | How to Quantify |
|------------|-----------------|
| Time saved | Hours × hourly rate |
| Errors avoided | Error cost × frequency |
| Revenue enabled | New revenue stream |
| Cost avoided | What we don't need to hire |

### Deliverables
1. Business case document (2 pages)
2. ROI calculation spreadsheet
3. Executive summary (1 slide)

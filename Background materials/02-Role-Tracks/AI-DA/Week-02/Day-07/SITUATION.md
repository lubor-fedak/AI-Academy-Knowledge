# Day 7: Prove the ROI

## AI-DA Track - Week 2, Day 7

### The Situation: "Is This Worth It?"

CFO asks: "We spent €200K on AI. What did we get?"
You have usage numbers. But that's not ROI.

**Challenge:** Calculate and communicate AI ROI.

### ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Value Generated - Cost) / Cost × 100

Value = Time Saved × Hourly Rate
      + Errors Prevented × Error Cost
      + Revenue Enabled
      
Cost = Development + Infrastructure + Operations
```

### Deliverables
1. ROI calculation model (spreadsheet)
2. Data-backed value quantification
3. Executive summary (1 page)

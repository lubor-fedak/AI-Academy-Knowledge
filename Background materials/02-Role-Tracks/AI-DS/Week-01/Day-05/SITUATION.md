# Day 5: Build the Evaluation Framework

## AI-DS Track - Week 1, Day 5

### The Situation: "We Need Automated Testing"

Manual evaluation doesn't scale. You can't have humans review every response.
Need automated evaluation that runs in CI/CD.

**Challenge:** Build automated evaluation pipeline.

### Evaluation Components
- Golden test dataset (questions + expected answers)
- Automated scoring (semantic similarity, keyword match)
- Quality thresholds (pass/fail criteria)
- Regression detection

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- Quality metrics definition
- Evaluation framework (code)
- Golden test dataset (50+ examples)
- Baseline quality report

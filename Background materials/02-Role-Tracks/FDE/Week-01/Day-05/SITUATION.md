# Day 5: Scope Creep Alert

## FDE Track - Week 1, Day 5

---

## The Situation

### "Can It Also..."

```
The GlobalBank demo was a hit! The VP loved it.

But now comes the dangerous part. In the follow-up call, 
the customer says:

"This is exactly what we need. But before we sign, 
can you also add:
- Multi-language support (we operate in 12 countries)
- Integration with our Salesforce CRM
- Sentiment analysis on customer queries
- A mobile app version
- Real-time document updates
- Audit logging for compliance
- SSO with our Azure AD
- Analytics dashboard

Oh, and we'd like all this in the original timeline and budget."

Your manager is on the call, nodding along. 
You need to save this deal without destroying your team.
```

## Your Challenge

Navigate scope creep while keeping the customer happy and the project viable.

### Success Looks Like

| Criterion | What Good Looks Like |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Clarity** | Clear separation of Phase 1 vs. Future |
| **Value** | Phase 1 solves their core problem |
| **Honesty** | Realistic about what's possible |
| **Relationship** | Customer feels heard, not dismissed |
| **Documentation** | Written scope that everyone agrees to |

### Deliverables

1. **Scoped Proposal** (1 page)
   - Phase 1: What we deliver now
   - Phase 2+: What comes later
   - Clear rationale for phasing

2. **Backlog** (prioritized list)
   - All requested features
   - Effort estimate (T-shirt size)
   - Recommended phase

3. **Customer Email** (draft)
   - Acknowledge all requests
   - Explain the phasing
   - Protect the relationship

## Micro-Context (5 minutes)

> Every FDE faces scope creep. Customers always want more. Your job isn't to say "no" - it's to say "yes, and here's how we do it sustainably."
>
> Key concepts:
> - **MVP** - Minimum Viable Product: smallest thing that delivers value
> - **MoSCoW** - Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
> - **Phase gating** - Proving value before adding complexity
>
> Your AI Tutor can help you think through prioritization. But YOU have to make the hard calls.
>
> Hint: The customer asked for 8 things. They probably only NEED 2-3 of them to solve their actual problem.

## Analysis Framework

### For Each Requested Feature

| Feature | Core Problem? | Effort | Dependencies | Phase |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Multi-language | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Salesforce | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Sentiment | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Mobile app | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Real-time updates | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Audit logging | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| SSO | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Analytics | ? | ? | ? | ? |

### Questions to Ask

For each feature:
1. **Why do they want this?** (underlying need)
2. **What happens if we don't do it now?** (urgency)
3. **What does it depend on?** (sequencing)
4. **How hard is it really?** (effort)

---

## The Real Conversation

### What They Said vs. What They Need

| They Said | They Might Need |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "Multi-language support" | Maybe just English + German for now? |
| "Salesforce integration" | Or just CSV export? |
| "Mobile app" | Or a responsive web app? |
| "Real-time updates" | Or daily batch refresh? |

**Always dig deeper.** The first request is rarely the real requirement.

### Phrases That Help

**Acknowledge:**
- "I hear you - that would be valuable"
- "That's a great idea for the roadmap"

**Clarify:**
- "Help me understand the use case for..."
- "What problem does that solve for your team?"

**Defer (gracefully):**
- "Let's prove the core value first, then add that"
- "Phase 2 is the perfect place for this"

**Protect:**
- "If we try to do everything, we risk delivering nothing"
- "I want to make sure we nail the foundation first"

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: Identifying the MUST haves (Click after 10 min)</summary>

Ask: "If we only delivered ONE thing, what would make this project successful?"

For GlobalBank, it's probably:
- Accurate document Q&A (core value)
- Audit logging (compliance is non-negotiable for banks)

Everything else is "nice to have" or "Phase 2."
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2: The phasing conversation (Click after 20 min)</summary>

Frame it as building on success:

"Here's my recommendation: Let's nail Phase 1 - accurate, auditable document Q&A for your English documents. Once that's proven and your team loves it, we add languages, integrations, and mobile in Phase 2.

This way, you get value fast, and we build on a solid foundation."

Subject: GlobalBank AI Assistant - Proposed Phasing

[Name],

Thank you for the great discussion. I'm excited about 
the vision for this project.

To deliver maximum value with minimum risk, I recommend 
we phase the implementation:

PHASE 1 (Current timeline & budget):
- Core document Q&A
- Audit logging for compliance
- English language

PHASE 2 (Following successful Phase 1):
- Multi-language support
- Salesforce integration
- Analytics dashboard

This approach lets you:
1. See value quickly
2. Validate the approach with real users
3. Refine requirements before we build more

I've attached a detailed breakdown. Happy to discuss.

[Your name]

## Role Play Exercise

Practice this conversation with a partner:

**Partner plays customer:**
- Push for everything in Phase 1
- Express urgency ("we need this for Q2")
- Question the phasing ("why can't you just do it all?")

**You play FDE:**
- Acknowledge their needs
- Explain the risks of overloading Phase 1
- Propose a path that works for both sides

## Week 1 Checkpoint

This is your **Week 1 Checkpoint**. Submit:

1. ✅ Working RAG demo (from Day 4)
2. ✅ Demo script
3. ✅ Scoped proposal (Phase 1 vs. Phase 2)
4. ✅ Prioritized backlog
5. ✅ Customer email draft
6. ✅ Reflection (300-500 words)

**Reflection prompts:**
- What was hardest about saying "not now" to features?
- How did you decide what's Phase 1 vs. Phase 2?
- What would you do differently next time?

---

## Connection to Next Week

Next week you'll go deeper: RAG pipelines that actually work, multi-agent systems, deployment, and production hardening. You'll build on what you started this week - but with more rigor.

# Mentor Notes - FDE Day-04

## Learning Objectives
Students should discover:
- How RAG pipelines work end-to-end
- Importance of chunking strategy
- Demo vs. production trade-offs

## Common Struggles
- Trying to build "perfect" solution immediately
- Ignoring edge cases until demo fails
- Not testing with realistic data

## Intervention Triggers
- Stuck more than 20 minutes with no progress
- Building complexity without working basics
- Skipping documentation entirely

## Debrief Talking Points
- What surprised you?
- What would you do differently?
- How would this scale to 1000 documents?

## Time Management
- 0-15 min: Planning (don't let them skip this)
- 15-50 min: Building (most productive time)
- 50-60 min: Testing and polish

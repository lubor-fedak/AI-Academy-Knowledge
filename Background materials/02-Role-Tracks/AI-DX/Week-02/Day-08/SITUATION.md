# Day 8: Design for Failure

## AI-DX Track - Week 2, Day 8

> Design & UX skill track supporting FDE, AI-FE and AI-PM (not a separate Designer job role in the Consult model).

### The Situation: "What If AI Gets It Wrong?"

The happy path looks great. But what about:
- AI gives wrong answer
- AI doesn't understand
- AI responds inappropriately
- AI is unavailable

**Challenge:** Design comprehensive failure states.

### Failure Scenarios
- Wrong answer (but confident)
- Don't know (honest uncertainty)
- Misunderstanding (needs clarification)
- Inappropriate (content filter triggered)
- Unavailable (system down)

### Deliverables
1. Failure state designs (all scenarios)
2. Recovery flow designs
3. Trust-rebuilding patterns

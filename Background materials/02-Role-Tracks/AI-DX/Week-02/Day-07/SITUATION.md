### The Situation: "Does This Actually Work?"

You have a design. But does it work for real users?
Time to test before engineering builds it.

**Challenge:** Create a testable prototype and conduct user testing.

### Testing Protocol
1. Recruit 5 users (from target personas)
2. Prepare tasks and scenarios
3. Think-aloud protocol
4. Capture insights
5. Iterate based on findings

### Deliverables
1. Interactive Figma prototype
2. User testing script
3. Testing session recordings (or notes)
4. Findings and recommendations

# Day 6: Design for Uncertainty

## AI-DX Track - Week 2, Day 6

> Design & UX skill track supporting FDE, AI-FE and AI-PM (not a separate Designer job role in the Consult model).

### The Situation: "How Confident Is It?"

The AI gives an answer. But is it right? 
Should the user trust it completely? Somewhat? Not at all?

**Challenge:** Design for AI uncertainty and confidence levels.

### Uncertainty Patterns
- Confidence indicators (high/medium/low)
- Source attribution
- "I'm not sure" acknowledgment
- Fallback to human options

### Deliverables
1. Confidence visualization design
2. Uncertainty messaging guidelines
3. Prototype with uncertainty states

# Day 4: Who Is the User?

## AI-DX Track - Week 1, Day 4

> Design & UX skill track supporting FDE, AI-FE and AI-PM (not a separate Designer job role in the Consult model).

### The Situation: "Design for Everyone"

Product says: "Our users are everyone."
That's not a user. That's avoiding a decision.

**Challenge:** Create actionable user personas for an AI product.

### Persona Components
- Demographics and context
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points and frustrations
- Technology comfort level
- AI expectations and fears

### Deliverables
1. 3 user personas (primary, secondary, edge)
2. Empathy maps for each
3. User needs prioritization

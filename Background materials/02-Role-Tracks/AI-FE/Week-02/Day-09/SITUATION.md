# Day 9: Mobile First

## AI-FE Track - Week 2, Day 9

### The Situation: "It's Broken on My Phone"

Desktop looks great. Mobile is a disaster.
Text overflows. Buttons are tiny. Keyboard covers the input.

**Challenge:** Create a responsive, mobile-first AI interface.

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch targets (minimum 44×44px)
- Viewport-aware layout
- Keyboard handling
- Offline capability
- Reduced data usage

### Deliverables
1. Mobile-responsive implementation
2. Touch-friendly interactions
3. Testing on 3 device sizes

# Day 5: When Things Go Wrong

## AI-FE Track - Week 1, Day 5

### The Situation: "Something Went Wrong"

The AI API fails. What does the user see?
- Option A: Blank screen (bad)
- Option B: "Error: 500" (worse)
- Option C: Red error with technical jargon (bad)
- Option D: Helpful message with next steps (good!)

**Challenge:** Design comprehensive error handling UI.

### Error State Requirements
- User-friendly language
- Actionable next steps
- Retry capability
- Graceful degradation

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- Loading states implementation
- Error handling implementation
- Component library started
- User testing summary

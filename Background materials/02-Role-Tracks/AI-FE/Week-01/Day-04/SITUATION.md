# Day 4: The Blank Screen

## AI-FE Track - Week 1, Day 4

### The Situation: "Is It Working?"

User clicks "Ask AI" and... nothing happens. For 30 seconds.
No loading indicator. No progress. No feedback.
They refresh. Start over. Give up.

**Challenge:** Design and implement loading states for AI interactions.

### Loading State Patterns
1. Immediate acknowledgment (<100ms)
2. Progress indicator (for long operations)
3. Skeleton screens (for structure)
4. Streaming response (show text as it arrives)

### Deliverables
1. Loading state design (all states)
2. React component implementation
3. User testing with 3 people

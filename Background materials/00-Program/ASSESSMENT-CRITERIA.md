# AI Academy - Assessment Criteria

## Philosophy

> We assess **learning quality**, not **task completion**.

This academy evaluates how you learn with AI, not how fast you finish or how much you memorize.

---

## What We Evaluate ✅

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **AI Collaboration Quality** | 30% | How effectively you work with AI Tutors |
| **Artifact Quality** | 30% | Quality of code, designs, documents produced |
| **Reflection & Growth** | 20% | Self-awareness, learning from mistakes |
| **Peer Contribution** | 10% | Helping others, quality of peer reviews |
| **Client Readiness** | 10% | Professional presentation, communication |

## What We DON'T Evaluate ❌

- Speed of completion
- Memorization of facts
- Number of tasks finished
- "Correct" answers (there often isn't one)
- Following instructions perfectly

---

## AI Collaboration Quality (30%)

### Excellent (90-100%)
- Asks precise, context-rich questions
- Iterates based on AI responses
- Challenges AI suggestions when appropriate
- Uses AI to explore multiple approaches
- Documents AI conversation insights

### Good (70-89%)
- Asks clear questions with some context
- Uses AI responses effectively
- Occasionally explores alternatives
- Generally productive AI interactions

### Developing (50-69%)
- Questions are vague or too broad
- Accepts first AI response without iteration
- Limited exploration of alternatives
- Conversations are superficial

### Needs Improvement (<50%)
- Copy-pastes without understanding
- Doesn't engage with AI meaningfully
- Ignores AI suggestions entirely
- No evidence of AI-assisted learning

## Artifact Quality (30%)

### Code Artifacts

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Excellent** | Works correctly, well-structured, documented, handles edge cases, testable |
| **Good** | Works correctly, reasonably structured, basic documentation |
| **Developing** | Partially works, structure issues, minimal documentation |
| **Needs Improvement** | Doesn't work, no structure, no documentation |

### Design Artifacts

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Excellent** | User-centered, clear rationale, considers edge cases, accessible |
| **Good** | Addresses user needs, mostly complete, some rationale |
| **Developing** | Basic design, missing considerations, weak rationale |
| **Needs Improvement** | Incomplete, no user consideration, no rationale |

### Document Artifacts

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Excellent** | Clear, well-structured, actionable, appropriate for audience |
| **Good** | Clear, mostly complete, generally appropriate |
| **Developing** | Some clarity issues, incomplete sections |
| **Needs Improvement** | Unclear, incomplete, wrong audience |

## Reflection & Growth (20%)

### What We Look For

1. **Self-awareness**
   - "I initially thought X, but then realized Y"
   - "My mistake was assuming..."
   - "Next time I would..."

2. **Learning transfer**
   - Connects today's learning to previous days
   - Sees patterns across different situations
   - Applies insights to new contexts

3. **Growth mindset**
   - Embraces challenges
   - Persists through difficulty
   - Sees feedback as opportunity

### Reflection Prompts (used in checkpoints)

- What was the hardest part and how did you overcome it?
- What would you do differently?
- What surprised you?
- How does this connect to what you learned earlier?

---

## Peer Contribution (10%)

### Excellent Peer Reviews
- Specific, actionable feedback
- Identifies both strengths and improvements
- Asks clarifying questions
- Offers concrete suggestions

### Poor Peer Reviews
- Vague ("looks good")
- Only positive or only negative
- No suggestions for improvement
- No engagement with the work

---

## Client Readiness (10%)

Can you present this work to a client?

| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Professionalism** | Is it polished? Free of errors? |
| **Communication** | Can you explain it clearly? |
| **Business Value** | Does it solve a real problem? |
| **Confidence** | Can you defend your decisions? |

---

## Weekly Checkpoint Structure

Each Friday, submit:

### 1. Artifact Package
- All code, designs, documents from the week
- README explaining what you built
- Any supporting materials

### 2. AI Conversation Export
- Export key conversations with AI Tutor
- Highlight 2-3 most valuable exchanges
- Note what you learned from each

### 3. Reflection (300-500 words)
- What did you learn?
- What was challenging?
- How did you grow?
- What will you do differently?

### 4. Peer Review (given to 1 classmate)
- Review their artifact
- Provide written feedback
- Use the rubric above

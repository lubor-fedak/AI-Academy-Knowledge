### SCENE 1: The Crisis

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Thank you for accepting this call on such short notice. I know it's late in New York."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "For a call from Brussels at this hour, I assumed it was urgent. What's happening?"

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "The AI Act. It comes into full force in August. And frankly... we have a problem."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "European companies are terrified. They see AI regulation as a burden, not an opportunity. Meanwhile, American and Chinese tech companies are racing ahead."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "I've seen the reports. Compliance paralysis. Innovation slowdown. Companies waiting instead of building."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Exactly. And I refuse to let the AI Act become Europe's competitive disadvantage."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "I need proof. Real proof. That European companies can deploy AI systems that are both compliant AND world-class. Not in two years. In weeks."

---

### SCENE 2: The Proposal

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "You want a demonstration. Something visible. Something that proves it can be done."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Four pilot projects. Four different countries. Four different industries. All AI Act compliant. All production-ready. All delivered before the summer deadline."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "Can your company do this?"

*(pause 3 sec - dramatic pause)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Madam Representative... this is exactly what we were built for."

*(pause 2 sec)*

> "We are not a consulting firm that delivers PowerPoints. We are not a technology vendor that sells licenses and walks away."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "We are engineers. We deploy. We operate. We deliver systems that work on day one."

---

### SCENE 3: The Plan

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Tell me what you need."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Six weeks. Sixty-four of our best specialists. Eight teams operating in parallel."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "We have exceptional talent in Central Europe. Czech Republic and Poland. Engineers who understand both the technical depth and the European business context."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "And the pilot companies?"

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "We've identified four. A major bank in Frankfurt struggling with AI-powered fraud detection. A manufacturing group in Lyon trying to implement predictive maintenance. A pharmaceutical company in Milan working on AI-assisted drug research. And an energy provider in Amsterdam building smart grid optimization."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "Different countries. Different industries. Different challenges. But one common goal: AI systems that are compliant, secure, and actually work."

---

### SCENE 4: The Stakes

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "And if you succeed?"

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "When we succeed... you'll have four case studies. Four proof points. Four European companies demonstrating that AI regulation and AI innovation are not opposites."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "And if something goes wrong? AI projects fail all the time. Seventy percent, according to some studies."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Those statistics come from traditional approaches. Long planning cycles. Handoffs between consultants and implementers. Death by committee."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "We do it differently. Small teams. Rapid deployment. Five days from concept to working prototype. We call it the Kyndryl Way."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Five days?"

*(pause 1 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Five days to first deployment. Six weeks to production-ready systems. That's our commitment."

---

### SCENE 5: Activation

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Then we have an agreement. I'll arrange access to the pilot companies. You mobilize your teams."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Consider it done. I'm activating Operation AI Ready Europe effective immediately."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "Eight SEAL units. Alpha through Hotel. Each one cross-functional. Engineers, architects, data scientists, security specialists. Everything needed to deliver end-to-end."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "SEAL units?"

*(pause 1 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Strategic Engineering and Advanced Learning teams. Our rapid deployment force. They don't just build AI systems. They transfer knowledge. When we leave, your clients can operate and improve the systems themselves."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "That's... not how consulting usually works."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "We're not consultants, Madam Representative. We're engineers. And engineers measure success by what works in production. Not by what looks good in a presentation."

---

### SCENE 6: Closing

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Then I wish your teams good luck. Europe is watching."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "Luck is for amateurs. We'll deliver. You have my word."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "Operation AI Ready Europe begins now."

*(pause 2 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Stay in touch. I want weekly updates."

*(pause 1 sec)*

**TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE (B):**
> "You'll have them. Secure channel. Same time."

*(pause 1 sec)*

> "Good night, Madam Representative."

*(pause 1 sec)*

**COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE (A):**
> "Good night. And... thank you."

## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

### Video Editing (CapCut/DaVinci Resolve):

1. **Timeline setup:**
   - Create split-screen template (50/50 or 60/40)
   - Add "secure connection" overlay graphics
   - Include location/encryption labels

2. **Audio:**
   - Add subtle static/encryption sound effects
   - Background: Low, tense ambient music
   - Consider slight voice distortion for "encrypted call" effect

3. **Visual effects:**
   - Occasional "signal interference" glitch
   - Subtle scan lines for classified feel
   - Green/blue tint for night-time secure call aesthetic

4. **Transitions:**
   - Cut between speakers naturally based on dialog
   - Highlight active speaker (slight brightness increase)
   - Dim inactive speaker slightly

### Recommended Music:
- Search: "Tense corporate thriller" or "Spy briefing ambient"
- Keep volume low - dialog is priority
- Fade out during closing text sequence

# Lab 08: Mentor Notes

## Key Concepts

1. **AI UX is different** - uncertainty, latency, non-determinism
2. **Accessibility is not optional** - legal and ethical requirement
3. **User testing reveals truth** - your assumptions are often wrong
4. **Mobile first** - many users are on phones

## Common Struggles

### "Streaming is hard"
**Intervention:** Start with fake streaming (setTimeout). Get UI right first, then real streaming.

### "My accessibility audit failed everything"
**Intervention:** Focus on the big wins first: color contrast, keyboard nav, focus states.

### "Users don't understand confidence indicators"
**Intervention:** Test different visual metaphors. Sometimes simpler is better.

## Debrief Topics

1. **AI-specific UX patterns:** What's different from traditional apps?
2. **Transparency vs. simplicity:** How much should we show users?
3. **Error recovery:** What happens when AI fails mid-stream?
4. **Trust calibration:** How do we help users know when to trust AI?

## What Good Looks Like

- Streaming feels smooth, not janky
- Loading states are informative
- Errors are recoverable
- Works with keyboard only
- Tested with real users

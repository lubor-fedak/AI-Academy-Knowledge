# Lab 08: AI Interface Prototyping

## Overview

Great AI needs great UX. In this lab, you'll design and prototype an AI-native user interface, focusing on the unique challenges of AI interactions: uncertainty, latency, streaming, and error handling.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Design interfaces for AI uncertainty and confidence
- Implement streaming response display
- Create accessible AI interfaces (WCAG 2.2)
- Handle loading, error, and edge states
- Conduct basic usability testing

## Prerequisites

- Completed Labs 01-03
- Basic React/HTML/CSS knowledge
- Familiarity with UI/UX principles

## Time Estimate

**Total: 90 minutes**
- Design system components: 25 minutes
- Streaming implementation: 25 minutes
- Accessibility: 20 minutes
- User testing: 20 minutes

## Target Roles

- **Primary:** AI-FE, AI-DX (Design/UX skill track supporting FDE capability)
- **Secondary:** All roles (UX awareness)

## The Challenge

Build a chat interface that handles:
- Streaming text responses (not just static)
- Confidence indicators (when AI isn't sure)
- Source citations (for RAG systems)
- Error states and recovery
- Accessibility for all users

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Streaming responses display in real-time
- [ ] Loading states are informative
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA compliant
- [ ] Tested with 3+ users
- [ ] Mobile responsive

## Deliverables

1. **Component library** (React or Figma)
2. **Working prototype** (interactive)
3. **Accessibility report**
4. **User testing findings**
5. **Reflection**

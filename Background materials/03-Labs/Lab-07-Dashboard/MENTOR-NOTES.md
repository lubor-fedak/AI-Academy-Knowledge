# Lab 07: Mentor Notes

## Key Concepts

1. **Metrics must be actionable** - if you can't act on it, why measure it?
2. **Context matters** - a number without context is meaningless
3. **Tell a story** - dashboards should answer questions, not just display data
4. **Start simple** - 5 great metrics beats 50 confusing ones

## Common Struggles

### "I don't know what to measure"
**Intervention:** Start with stakeholder questions. "What would the CEO want to know?"

### "My dashboard is too cluttered"
**Intervention:** Apply the "one insight per visual" rule. Remove redundancy.

### "The numbers don't tell a story"
**Intervention:** Add comparison (vs. last week, vs. target). Add annotations.

## Debrief Topics

1. **What makes a good KPI?** Specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, time-bound
2. **Dashboard design principles:** Visual hierarchy, progressive disclosure
3. **Data quality:** Garbage in, garbage out. How do you trust your data?
4. **Privacy considerations:** What PII might be in logs?

## What Good Looks Like

- Clear KPI definitions with owners
- Dashboard tells a story at a glance
- Executive summary is actually executive-friendly
- Data pipeline is reproducible

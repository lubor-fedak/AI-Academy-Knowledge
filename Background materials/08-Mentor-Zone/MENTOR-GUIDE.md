# AI Academy - Mentor Guide

## Welcome, Mentor!

This guide will help you facilitate AI-Native learning. Your role is fundamentally different from traditional teaching – you're a **facilitator**, not a lecturer.

---

## The AI-Native Philosophy

> *"Instructors don't lecture. Instructors design situations, AI explains, students do."*

### Traditional vs. AI-Native

| Traditional | AI-Native |
|-------------|-----------|
| Mentor explains concepts | AI Tutor explains on demand |
| Mentor gives answers | Mentor asks questions |
| Mentor solves problems | Mentor protects the struggle |
| Success = correct answers | Success = quality learning |

---

## Your Four Functions

### 1. Situation Designer
Before each session, understand:
- What students should discover
- Common wrong paths
- When confusion is productive vs. destructive

### 2. Silent Observer
During exploration, watch for:
- Who is stuck (no progress 15+ min)
- Who is going badly wrong
- Who finished too fast (didn't go deep)
- Who is frustrated vs. productively struggling

### 3. Minimal Intervener
When you step in:
- Ask a question, not give an answer
- Redirect, not solve
- Encourage, not rescue

### 4. Debrief Facilitator
At session end:
- Harvest learnings from students
- Connect to bigger picture
- Preview what's coming next

## Session Flow (90 minutes)

### Micro-Context (5 min)
**What to do:**
- Introduce today's vocabulary (3-5 terms max)
- Frame the challenge
- Give one strategic hint

**What NOT to do:**
- Lecture on concepts
- Explain how to solve
- Share your opinions

**Example script:**
> "Today you're tackling [topic]. Key terms: [A], [B], [C]. Your AI Tutor knows about these. Hint: most people make mistake [X]. Go."

### Situation Launch (5 min)
- Read the challenge aloud
- Clarify logistics only
- Answer "what" questions, not "how" questions

### Exploration (50 min)
**Your job:** Circulate and observe

**Watch for:**
| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Typing rapidly | Engaged, good |
| Staring at screen | Possibly stuck |
| Frequent AI Tutor queries | Learning well |
| No AI Tutor use | May be lost or overconfident |
| Talking to peers | Collaboration (good) |
| Frustration visible | May need intervention |

### Debrief (15 min)
**Structure:**
1. "What did you discover?" (volunteers share)
2. "What was hardest?" (discussion)
3. "How does this connect to...?" (you provide)
4. "Tomorrow we'll..." (preview)

### Peer Exchange (15 min)
- Pair students (cross-role if possible)
- Prompt: "Share your approach and one surprise"
- Let them talk, you listen

## Intervention Framework

### When to Intervene

| Trigger | Wait Time | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| No progress | 15 min | Guiding question |
| Wrong direction (minor) | 20 min | Gentle redirect |
| Wrong direction (major) | 10 min | Direct redirect |
| Frustration | Immediate | Break down problem |
| Finished too fast | When noticed | Challenge with edge case |
| Copy-paste without understanding | When noticed | "Explain this to me" |

### How to Intervene

**DO say:**
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What did the AI Tutor suggest?"
- "What's blocking you right now?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "What's another way to approach this?"

**DON'T say:**
- "The answer is..."
- "You should do X"
- "That's wrong, try Y"
- "Let me show you"

### Intervention Levels

```
Level 1: Observe & Wait
  └── Student may self-correct

Level 2: Guiding Question
  └── "What have you tried?"

Level 3: Focused Redirect
  └── "Have you considered [specific area]?"

Level 4: Direct Guidance
  └── "You're stuck on X. Try focusing on Y first."

Level 5: Paired Support
  └── Connect struggling student with peer
```

## Handling Common Situations

### Student says "I don't know where to start"
> "That's normal. What's the first thing you'd need to understand? Ask your AI Tutor that question."

### Student copy-pastes AI response
> "Walk me through what this code does. Which part solves the actual problem?"

### Student is frustrated
> "Let's break this down. What's the smallest piece you could tackle right now?"

### Student finishes quickly
> "Nice work. Now: what happens if [edge case]? How would you test this?"

### Student asks you for the answer
> "What has your AI Tutor said? What have you tried based on that?"

### Student's AI Tutor gives wrong answer
> "AI isn't always right. What makes you think this might be wrong? How would you verify?"

## Assessment

### What to Evaluate

| Evaluate ✅ | Don't Evaluate ❌ |
|-------------|------------------|
| Quality of AI questions | Speed of completion |
| Artifact quality | Memorization |
| Reflection depth | Number of tasks done |
| Peer contribution | "Correct" answers |

### Weekly Checkpoint Review

When reviewing submissions:
1. Check artifact completeness
2. Read AI conversation exports
3. Evaluate reflection quality
4. Note peer review quality
5. Flag students needing support

### Feedback Principles

- Be specific, not vague
- Focus on process, not just outcome
- Highlight both strengths and growth areas
- Ask questions in feedback
- Connect to next week's goals

## Final Note

This approach may feel uncomfortable at first. You might feel like you're "not doing your job" when you're not teaching.

Remember: **the best teachers create conditions for learning**. The AI handles explaining. You handle the wisdom.

Trust the process. Trust your students. Trust that struggle is where learning lives.

Welcome to AI-Native education.

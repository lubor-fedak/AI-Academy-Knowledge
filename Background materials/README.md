## 👥 Role Taxonomy & FDE Capability

| Role / Capability | Code | Focus Area |
|-------------------|------|------------|
| **Forward Deployed Engineer (Capability)** | **FDE** | End-to-end client-facing AI delivery: discovery, architecture, implementation, value realization |
| ├─ AI Software Engineering (within FDE) | **AI-SE** | Platform development, CI/CD, LLMOps, reliability |
| ├─ Front-End & Experience Engineering (within FDE) | **AI-FE** | AI-native UI, streaming, accessibility, interaction patterns |
| └─ Data & Analytics (within FDE) | **AI-DA** | Data pipelines, KPIs, dashboards, ROI storytelling |
| AI Data Scientist | **AI-DS** | Model evaluation, experiments, quality |
| AI Product Manager | **AI-PM** | Use-case framing, roadmaps, stakeholders |
| AI Security Consultant | **AI-SEC** | Threat modeling, red teaming, guardrails |
| Design & UX (cross-cutting skill, not a separate Consult job role) | **AI-DX** | Journey mapping, prototyping, UX research embedded into FDE/AI-FE/AI-PM work |

**Note:** In the Consult role model, AI-SE and AI-FE/DA skills sit inside the **Forward Deployed Engineer capability**, not as standalone job families.  
The **AI-DX track** in this academy strengthens design and UX skills for participants (primarily FDE/AI-FE/AI-PM) but **does not represent a separate Designer job role in the schedule**.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy: AI-Native Education

> *"Instructors don't lecture. Instructors design situations, AI explains, students do."*

This academy uses an **AI-Native** approach:

- **No lengthy lectures** – 5-minute micro-contexts only
- **Situation-based learning** – Real-world challenges, not tutorials
- **AI Tutors** – Personalized guidance via ChatGPT Enterprise
- **Productive struggle** – Learning through doing and failing
- **Mentor as facilitator** – Guides direction, not answers

# AI Academy - Day 1: AI Landscape & Foundations

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Speaker:** Lubor Fedák  
**Topic:** Introduction to Agentic AI, Tooling Setup, and Course Overview

## 1. Overview & Objectives
The academy focuses on moving beyond simple AI usage to building **Autonomous Agentic Systems**. The goal is to train agents that can build other agents and perform complex, self-healing tasks. By the end of the 5-6 week course, participants will participate in a hackathon to put these skills into practice.

**Key Concept:** "Kyndryl Agentic Framework" (KAF) - The operational cookbook for the course.

## 2. Logistics & Platforms
*   **Hub:** `Kindrio AI online` (Education Portal - registration required).
*   **Communication:** MS Teams Channel ("General AI Academy").
*   **Materials:** OneDrive (Daily content), SharePoint (Long-term archive).
*   **AI Tutors:** Custom AI agents will be provided to assist with exercises and learning.

## 3. Technology Stack & Tooling
The course utilizes a specific set of tools. High priority is placed on getting access immediately.

| Tool | Purpose | Access Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ChatGPT (Enterprise)** | Primary LLM for learning, secure for company data. | Request via Kyndryl "AI Garage Lab" / "AI at Work". |
| **Microsoft 365 Copilot** | Integration with internal apps (Teams, SharePoint). | Standard Corporate Access. |
| **Google Gemini** | **Crucial.** Used for "Google Agent Space" & Deep Thinking. | Request **Kyndryl Google ID** via Okta Verify / Service Desk. |
| **GitHub** | Code & Knowledge Repository. | Personal Account + Corporate "Gemu" license (Week 2). |
| **Google AI Studio** | Rapid prototyping and development. | Via Google ID. |
| **Claude / Cursor** | Advanced reasoning and coding assistance. | Recommended if available/approved. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Action Item**: Request your **Kyndryl Google ID** immediately if you haven't already. It allows access to Gemini Free Pro and Partner Advantage benefits.

## 4. Core Concepts: The Agentic Shift
*   **Evolution:** From "Chatbots" -> "Agentic AI".
*   **Agent capabilities:** Autonomous communication, personality creation, community building.
*   **Example from the Wild:** The speaker mentioned "Christopharianism" (agents creating their own religion) and "Mold Hub" (agents sharing data/videos) as examples of unfiltered agent-to-agent interaction.
*   **Goal for Enterprise:** Harness this power for controlled, secure corporate environments using the **Kyndryl Agentic Framework**.

## 5. Homework & Exercises

### A. Immediate Setup
1.  **Request Access:** Ensure you have access to ChatGPT Enterprise and have requested your Kyndryl Google ID.
2.  **GitHub Setup:**
    *   Create a **Personal GitHub Account** (if you don't have one).
    *   Generate a **Personal Access Token (Classic)**.
        *   *Scopes:* `repo` (read/write).
        *   *Expiration:* ~30 days.
    *   *Why?* This allows AI tools (like Gemini/Copilot) to push code and notes to your repo on your behalf.

### B. "Design Your First Agent" (Mental Exercise)
**Task:** Brainstorm an agent that would solve a real problem in your daily work.
*   **Method:** Use an LLM (Copilot/ChatGPT) as a "Tutor".
*   **Prompt to use:** "Help me design an AI agent that helps with [Task X]. What should be its instructions, inputs, and integrations?"
*   **Deliverable:**
    *   Agent Name & Role.
    *   System Instructions (The "Prompt").
    *   Inputs (e.g., Emails, SharePoint, PDFs).
    *   *Note:* You do not need to code this yet. Just define the logic.

## 6. Useful Links & Resources
*   [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
*   [GitHub - Microsoft AI for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners) (Reference learning material)
*   **Internal:** Search "AI at Work" or "Garage Lab" on internal SharePoint for tool requests.
